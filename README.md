# Week2HW
Week 2 Homework- About Me

This coursework contains three pages- index, portfolio, contact
The contact me does not work (however if you click it goes to an about.blank page) 
The footer is working properly and not hiding any information. Also made links to social media (github, linkedin, email)
Header has been a joy to work with (thanks to bootstrap) I moved my drop down menu under the "hamburger"
Portfolio- Added placeholders (since I am still new at everything and dont have alot of projects), but did add HW Week one, as well ad my pre-work for the HTML.
Very proud that this is the start of my portfolio. I know I will look back on this in a couple of months and think how juvenile it was :)

Screenshots of validator. The only thing it got was links that were dead? However going back they worked or did the job. IE- Stylesheet for google fonts.
