# Portfolio- Jason West 

Portfolio has been updated from week 2 and have added our group project, weather api dashboard, day planner and multiple choice quiz.

I decided to axe the contact me page. I currently have my resume on the page for the user to download as well as having the link to my email currently on my footer. 

Colors have been updated to reflect my styling preferences.
